        <h3>‚ú® Key Features</h3>
        <p><strong>Connect 4: AI Showdown</strong> is a fully-featured two-player game built using React. Initially a basic project, it's now a polished, animated experience with dynamic AI opponents and visual feedback.</p>
        <p>You can play against a friend or challenge a computer opponent with 4 distinct AI difficulty levels ‚Äî including an <strong>Impossible</strong> mode powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.</p>
        <p>The game highlights winning moves, includes a confetti celebration on victory, and adapts its AI behavior based on your selection. It also features animations, improved UI/UX, and a redesigned game mode menu.</p>
        <p>Whether you‚Äôre learning about game theory or just looking for a quick match, give it a shot!</p>
        <hr />
<p><em>Developer Note:</em> This was one of my earliest React projects. Rebuilding it from scratch gave me the chance to explore AI algorithms like Minimax, level up my UI/UX skills, and create a genuinely fun user experience. The Impossible AI still beats me sometimes ‚Äî and I wrote it!</p>
