    <h3>✨ Key Features</h3>
    <p><strong>Connect 4: AI Showdown</strong> is a fully-featured two-player game built using React and Node.js.
      Originally a local-only project, it's grown into a polished, real-time multiplayer experience with dynamic AI and
      engaging visuals.</p>

    <p>You can play against a friend in real time through online multiplayer, choosing to host a <strong>private
        room</strong> with a code or a <strong>public room</strong> that others can join from the lobby. It’s powered by
      a live Node.js backend using <strong>Socket.IO</strong>.</p>

    <p>Prefer solo play? Challenge a computer opponent with 4 distinct AI difficulty levels — including an
      <strong>Impossible</strong> mode powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.</p>

    <p>The game highlights winning moves, plays sound effects, includes a confetti celebration on victory, and adapts
      its AI behavior based on your difficulty selection. It also features animations, rematch logic, a polished UI/UX,
      and a responsive design for play on any screen size.</p>

    <p>Whether you’re learning about game theory or just looking for a quick match, give it a shot!</p>
    
    <p>New in <strong>v3.0</strong>: Introducing <strong>Spectator Mode</strong>! Friends can now watch live games in real time with synced gameplay, player highlights, and an updated UI that shows who's watching. Perfect for streamers, friends, or just keeping an eye on the competition.</p>

    <hr />
    <p><em>Developer Note:</em> This was one of my earliest React projects. Rebuilding it from scratch let me dive deeper into AI algorithms, real-time multiplayer architecture, and UI/UX design. The Impossible AI still beats me sometimes — and I wrote it! 😅!</p>
