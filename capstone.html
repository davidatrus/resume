            <h1>Building an Innovative Traffic Management System</h1>

            <p>This project aims to develop an innovative traffic management system that utilizes heat maps to visualize traffic density at specific intersections. The system will employ image processing techniques using YOLO and data analytics to create heat maps from pictures or traffic data with the pandas library from Python, providing a visual representation of traffic density and identifying congestion hotspots.</p>
            
            <p>The effectiveness of the heat map-based traffic management system will be evaluated through simulations and real-world tests. The project is expected to demonstrate the potential of heat maps and machine learning as tools for improving traffic management, leading to more efficient and responsive traffic control systems.

                <li>Aimed at creating a backbone for even larger systems that will eventually require this tool.</li>
                <li>In a real world environment the tool is aimed to be embedded into real traffic intersections where images can be taken of each intersection for more effective data usage
